<h1>Lord of the Rings</h1>
<p>The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.</p>
<p>I like this movie because it has a lot of action and is a super interesting story. I love the characters because they vary a lot in personality. My favorite character is Legolas because he is a super awesome elf who is a great archer with awesome hair.</p>
