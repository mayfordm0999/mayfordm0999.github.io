<h2>Why are the Packers my Favorite Team?</h2><p>I like the Packers for many reasons. One reason is that my dad is from Wisconcin, and he was the one who got me interested in football. He grew up a Packers fan and so he would always be watching the Packers play, and sometimes I would sit down and watch too. Another reason I like the Packers is because people who watch, wear hats of cheeese which is totally awesome. And finally, because Aaron Rodgers is a great quarter back who an throw super far.</p>
